<h2>Project 1</h2>

<b>Part 2 and 3 - 8 LED Controller using ATMega16</b><br>
Enables LED #1 to #8 respectively as the PINA.0 of ATMega16 changes to 1. This loop will continue as far as the PINA.0 stays 1.<br>
Also, there is a delay (0.5 seconds) to be able to detect the procedure of the circuit.<br><br>

<b>Part 4 - AVR Micro-Controller Clock</b><br>
Information about AVR micro-controllerâ€™ clock details. Furthermore, represents a couple of data about its internal clock.<br>
