<h2>Project 1</h2>

<b>Part 1 - Toggle Pin by Clock</b><br>
<ul>
  <li>Toggle PORTA.0 to 0 and 1 every 0.5 seconds</li>
  <li>Using ATMega16 and clock frequency has been set to 12.000000Mhz</li>
</ul>

<b>Part 2 and 3 - 8 LED Controller using ATMega16</b><br>
<ul>
  <li>Enables LED #1 to #8 respectively as the PINA.0 of ATMega16 changes to 1. This loop will continue as far as the PINA.0 stays 1</li>
  <li>P.S: There is a delay (0.5 seconds) to be able to detect the procedure of the circuit</li>
</ul>

<b>Part 4 - AVR Micro-Controller Clock</b><br>
<ul>
  <li>Information about AVR micro-controllerâ€™ clock details</li>
  <li>Represents a couple of data about its internal clock</li>
</ul>

<b>Part 5 - LED Currents and Resistance</b><br>
<ul>
  <li>Forward current and maximum current in LEDs</li>
  <li>How to calculate their resistance</li>
</ul>
